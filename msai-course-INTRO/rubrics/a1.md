# Rubric: A1 Git Workflow

| Criterion | Full | Partial | None |
|-----------|------|---------|------|
| Branch + PR | Branch name clear (e.g. a1/…), PR into main | PR exists but branch naming unclear | No PR |
| README “How to run” | Clear steps: setup, run, test, eval; mentions OPENROUTER_API_KEY | Vague or incomplete | Missing or wrong |
| CI | Green (pytest + eval) | Red or skipped | No CI |
| Commit message | Descriptive (e.g. “A1: add How to run”) | Generic | Missing or misleading |

**Score:** Instructor discretion (e.g. Full = 100%, Partial = 70%, None = 0% per row).  
**Subjective:** Code review checklist (if used) and clarity of README.
