# Assignment 3: Prompting basics

## Goals

- Write clear, specific prompts and see how they change model output.
- Compare one prompt run with the **coding AI** (Continue) and one with the **Tutor AI** (right sidebar).

## Tasks

1. **Same question, two panels**  
   Ask the same conceptual question (e.g. “What is a loop in programming?” or “What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?”) in:
   - **Continue** (coding AI), and  
   - **Tutor AI** (right sidebar).  
   Copy or summarize the first few sentences of each response below.

2. **Refine a prompt**  
   Pick one of the answers. Write a **follow-up prompt** that asks for more detail or an example. Run it in the same panel and note how the answer changed.

3. **Document your work** below (replace the placeholders).
