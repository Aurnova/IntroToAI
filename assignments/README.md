# Assignments

This folder contains **5 assignments** (one per week) for Intro to AI. Do the work in each assignment’s folder and push to the default branch to submit.

| # | Folder | Topic |
|---|--------|--------|
| 1 | [01-getting-started](01-getting-started/README.md) | Setup, Codespaces, first edit and push |
| 2 | [02-what-is-ai](02-what-is-ai/README.md) | What is AI? Short definition and reflection |
| 3 | [03-prompting-basics](03-prompting-basics/README.md) | Prompting: same question in Continue vs Tutor, then refine |
| 4 | [04-coding-with-ai](04-coding-with-ai/README.md) | Use Continue to write or fix a small program |
| 5 | [05-final-project-and-reflection](05-final-project-and-reflection/README.md) | Tutor + small project + limitations + final reflection |

## What to do

1. **Read the assignment** – Open the README for the assignment (e.g. `02-what-is-ai/README.md`).
2. **Do the work** – Write your answers or code in that folder as the README specifies.
3. **Commit and push** – Push to the default branch (usually `main`) before the deadline.

## Submitting

- Push your latest changes to the **default branch** before the deadline.
- Your instructor will grade from this repo. If they use Google Classroom, they may ask you to turn in the link to your repo there as well.

## Using the AI assistants

You can use **Continue** (coding) and **Tutor AI** (concepts) for help. Your institution usually provides an OpenRouter key (set on your repo); see the main [README](../README.md) if you need to add `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` yourself.
