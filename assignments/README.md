# Assignments

This folder contains course assignments. Each assignment may have its own subfolder or a single shared document, depending on how your instructor sets things up.

## What to do

1. **Read the assignment** – Open the README or instructions for the assignment (e.g. `01-getting-started/README.md` or a link from your syllabus).
2. **Do the work** – Write code, answers, or files in the places the assignment specifies (often in the same folder or a dedicated `solutions/` or `your-work/` folder).
3. **Commit and push** – Save your work with git and push to the default branch so your instructor can see it.

## Submitting

- Push your latest changes to the **default branch** (usually `main`) before the deadline.
- Your instructor will grade from this repo. If they use a specific branch name or tag for submission, they will tell you.

## Using the AI assistant

You can use the **Continue** panel (Qwen3 Coder Next via OpenRouter) to help with understanding, drafting, or debugging. Follow the main [README](../README.md) to set `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` in your Codespace if you haven’t already.
