# Assignment 5: Final project and reflection

## Goals

- Use the **Tutor AI** to learn a concept and the **coding AI (Continue)** on a small project.
- Notice a limitation (when the AI is wrong or not the right tool) and reflect on when to trust it.
- Look back on the course and what you’ll take forward.

## Tasks

### Part 1: Tutor for a concept

1. **Pick a concept** from the course (e.g. “What is overfitting?” or “What is a function?”).
2. **Ask the Tutor AI** to explain it. Follow the Tutor’s questions or hints (at least 2–3 exchanges).
3. **Summarize** below: the concept, one question the Tutor asked you, and how it helped.

**Concept you asked about:**  
*(Replace this line.)*

**One question or hint the Tutor gave you:**  
*(Replace this line.)*

**In 1–2 sentences, how did the Tutor’s way (questions/hints) compare to just getting a definition?**  
*(Replace this line.)*

### Part 2: Small project with both tools

4. **Do a small project** (code, analysis, or short document) using **Continue** for implementation and **Tutor AI** for understanding or planning. Put deliverables in this folder (e.g. `script.py`, `report.md`, or `notebook.ipynb`).

**What your project does (one sentence):**  
*(Replace this line.)*

**How you used Continue:**  
*(1–2 sentences.)*

**How you used the Tutor AI:**  
*(1–2 sentences.)*

### Part 3: One limitation

5. **Find a limitation** – Ask the AI something you can check (or that’s out of scope) and note when it’s wrong or vague.

**What you asked:**  
*(Replace this line.)*

**What the AI said / how you knew it was wrong or limited:**  
*(1–2 sentences.)*

**When would you trust this AI for coursework, and when would you double-check?**  
*(1–2 sentences.)*

### Part 4: Final reflection

6. **Answer** the following.

**Most useful way you used the coding AI (Continue) in this course:**  
*(2–3 sentences.)*

**Most useful way you used the Tutor AI:**  
*(2–3 sentences.)*

**One skill or idea from this course you want to use in the future:**  
*(1–2 sentences.)*

7. **Commit and push** all files in this folder. That’s your submission.

Thank you for completing Intro to AI.
