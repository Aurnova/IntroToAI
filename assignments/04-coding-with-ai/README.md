# Assignment 4: Coding with AI

## Goals

- Use the **Continue** (coding AI) panel to write or modify a small program.
- Practice giving clear instructions and reviewing the generated code.

## Tasks

1. **Choose a task** (or use one your instructor specified), for example:
   - A short Python script that reads a list of numbers and prints the sum and average.
   - A function that checks if a string is a palindrome.
   - A tiny script in another language you’re learning.
2. **Use Continue** to generate the code: describe the task in the chat, accept or edit the suggestion, and save the file in this folder (e.g. `solution.py` or `palindrome.py`).
3. **Run and fix** the code (in the terminal or via Run). If something is wrong, ask Continue to fix it and document what you changed.
4. **Answer** the short reflection below.

**What you asked the AI to build (one sentence):**

**Did the first response run correctly, or did you need to ask for changes? Describe briefly.**

5. **Commit and push** your code and this README. That’s your submission.
