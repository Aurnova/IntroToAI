# Intro to AI

A hands-on course introducing artificial intelligence concepts and practice. The course runs on **GitHub Codespaces** with built-in AI assistants: a **Cursor-like coding AI** and a **Tutor AI** for Socratic, conceptual help.

---

## What you'll do

- **Environment:** Work in the cloud with GitHub Codespaces—no local install. Each student gets a consistent dev environment and their own assignment repo via GitHub Classroom. The IDE (Continue + Tutor AI) is provided by separate repos ([ai-ide](https://github.com/Aurnova/ai-ide), [ai-tutor](https://github.com/Aurnova/ai-tutor)) and wired in by the course devcontainer.
- **Coding AI:** Use the Continue panel (Qwen3 Coder Next via OpenRouter) for chat, edits, and autocomplete—similar to Cursor.
- **Tutor AI:** Use the right-side Tutor AI tab for conceptual questions, hints, and guided learning instead of full answers.
- **Assignments:** Complete coursework in the `assignments/` folder of your repo; push to submit.

## For students

1. **Accept the assignment** using the GitHub Classroom link from your instructor.
2. **Open your repo in Codespaces** (Code → Codespaces → Create codespace on main).
3. **API key:** Your institution provides one OpenRouter key per student ($10/month limit), usually already set on your repo. If not, add it as a Codespaces/repo secret named `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`. [Create your own](https://openrouter.ai/settings/keys) only if your course doesn’t provide keys.
4. **Do the work** in `assignments/` and push to submit.

## For instructors

- Use the repo as a **GitHub Classroom template** to create one repo per student.
- See [.github/CLASSROOM_SETUP.md](https://github.com/Aurnova/IntroToAI/blob/main/.github/CLASSROOM_SETUP.md) in the repo for setup steps.
